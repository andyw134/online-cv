  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    Pragmatic Engineering Director with 10+ years delivering enterprise-grade infrastructure and data platforms at resource-constrained startups. Built SRE, Security, and Data Engineering capability from ground up at Render Networks, managing $1M infrastructure budget while maintaining 99.99% uptime, achieving ISO 27001:2022 certification, and consistently reducing costs as the business scales.
    
    Expert in right-sizing technology decisions for business needs—choosing serverless over Kubernetes, managed services over self-hosted complexity, and strategic vendor negotiations over premature optimization. Recent achievements include architecting event-driven microservices migration, implementing AI(LLM)-powered quality control tool for image processing (80% accuracy), leading 100% LLM adoption across 20 engineers (2K+ Copilot completions/month), and delivering $105K annual cost savings through platform modernization.
    
    Proven track record building high-performing teams with strong retention, interviewing/hiring for dozens of roles, and maintaining hands-on technical leadership while operating cross-functionally. Technical expertise spans AWS, event-driven architecture, modern data platforms (Databricks, dbt), and cost-effective infrastructure decisions. Seeking Director-level role combining strategic technical leadership with hands-on engineering at growing companies.
